Your body is made up of millions of cells. To make energy, these cells need food in a very simple form. When you eat or drink, much of your food is broken down into a simple sugar called \"glucose.\" Then, glucose is transported through your bloodstream to the cells of your body where it can be used to provide some of the energy your body needs for daily activities. The amount of glucose in your bloodstream is regulated by the hormone insulin. Insulin is always being released in small amounts by your pancreas. When the amount of glucose in your blood rises to a certain level, your pancreas will release more insulin to push more glucose into your cells. This causes your blood glucose level to drop.To keep it from getting too low (hypoglycemia or low blood sugar), your body signals you to eat and releases some glucose stored in your liver.People with diabetes either don\\'t make insulin or their body\\'s cells are resistant to insulin, leading to high levels of sugar circulating in the blood, called simply high blood sugar. By definition, diabetes is having a blood')"
